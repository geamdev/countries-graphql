## More Details

### What do we use to make graphql requests?

To make the requests we use [apollo-client](https://www.apollographql.com/) which allows us to work with graphql in a simple and fast way.

### Why we use GraphQL Code Generator?

To get all the types we have in our API, we use [graphql-code-generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com) as it allows us to obtain the TypeScript typing of each of our entities, which saves us time by not having to define the types ourselves.
